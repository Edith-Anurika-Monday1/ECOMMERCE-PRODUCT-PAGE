# E-commerce Product Page

![Design preview for the E-commerce product page project](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! üëã

Thanks for checking out my e-commerce product page project.

This is a custom-built solution inspired by a Frontend Mentor challenge. I recreated the entire design using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **TypeScript**. The goal was to produce a pixel-perfect, fully responsive, and interactive product page, closely matching the provided design mockups while writing clean, maintainable, and well-structured code.

---

## Project Overview

The page allows users to:

- View an optimal layout for mobile and desktop devices.
- See hover states for all interactive elements.
- Open a lightbox gallery when clicking the main product image.
- Switch the displayed image by clicking on thumbnails.
- Select a product quantity and add it to the cart.
- View the cart‚Äôs contents and remove items if needed.
- See the total price update dynamically based on quantity.

All interactions, states, and styles were implemented as specified in the design folder ‚Äî including **basket filled**, **basket empty**, **lightbox**, **mobile menu states**, and responsive layouts.

---

## Features Implemented

- **Responsive Design** ‚Äî Works seamlessly from 320px up to large screens.
- **Lightbox Image Gallery** ‚Äî Desktop and mobile lightbox support with navigation.
- **Dynamic Cart Functionality** ‚Äî Add, update, and remove products from the cart.
- **Quantity Selector** ‚Äî Increment/decrement (no negative values).
- **Keyboard Accessibility** ‚Äî Focus states and ARIA labels for screen readers.
- **Pixel-Perfect Styling** ‚Äî All typography, colors, and spacing matched the style guide.

---

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5** ‚Äî Semantic markup.
- **CSS3** ‚Äî Flexbox, CSS variables, responsive design.
- **TypeScript** ‚Äî For type-safe DOM manipulation and event handling.
- **Fonts** ‚Äî [Kumbh Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Kumbh+Sans).
- **Tools** ‚Äî VS Code, Node.js, TypeScript compiler (`tsc`).

## Style Guide Compliance

All colors, typography, and layout specifications follow the provided **style-guide**:

**Primary Colors**

## What i learnt

1. Integrating TypeScript into a small front-end project for type safety.

2. Creating accessible, keyboard-navigable modals (lightbox).

3. Building a cart system without external libraries.

5. Writing responsive layouts that matched static design files and style guide.

  ## Future Improvements
- Include checkout page.
- Add animations for image transitions and cart interactions.
- Implement localStorage for cart persistence.
- Add unit tests for cart logic and image gallery navigation.
- Extend to multiple product variant pages with routing.

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18 or higher recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)
- A code editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) **installed globally**.
